Pixelbits is a Swift 2 based library that reads a JSON file and applies styles to the `UIView` objects you create in your iOS application. It's a bit like CSS for iOS.

## How to install

Currently you can only include pixelbits by using cocoapods directly from this git repository:

`pod 'pixelbits', :git => 'https://github.com/depl0y/pixelbits.git'`

## How does this work?

Please visit the [Documentation](http://depl0y.github.io/pixelbits/).
